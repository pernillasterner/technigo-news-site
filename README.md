# Project Overview

For this project my main focus was on responsive design and the layout techniques of CSS Grid and Flexbox.

## Project Focus

### Hero Section with Flexbox

Implemented CSS Flexbox to easily center the content in the hero section.

### Latest News Section Position

Implemented CSS Position for this section since I wanted some of the images extend beyond their usual boundaries.

### Top Stories Grid Layout

Implemented a responsive grid layout using CSS Grid, providing easy control over the number of columns based on the viewport size.
